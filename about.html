        <h1>Welcome to TraysToTummies</h1>
        <p>
            Trays to Tummies is a private nonprofit organization primarily 
            founded to counter issues concerning food wastage and food waste, 
            in our district and schools across the country. At Trays to Tummies, 
            our mission is to collect as many wasted food items as possible 
            from schools and redistribute them to various food pantries. Currently, 
            weâ€™re based in Heritage High School, but we do hope to expand to other 
            schools in the district. As an organization, we sincerely hope to 
            contribute to ending hunger and wastage in the best possible way!

        <h1>Future Plans</h1>
        <p id="future">Currently, our non-profit is based only in Heritage High School, where 
            we started, but we are seeking to expand locally to expand our impact.
            We aspire to expand our cause to possibly other schools in our district 
            by next year, however, we hope to first expand to Maus & Roach Middle
            school by next semester.
